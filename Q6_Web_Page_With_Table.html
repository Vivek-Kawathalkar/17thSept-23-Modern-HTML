    <h2>Difference between HTML and HTML5</h2>
    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>HTML</th>
                <th>HTML5</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier versions had limited input types for form elements, such as text, password, checkbox, radio, etc.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced new input types like email, url, number, date, range, color, tel, etc., making it easier to validate and handle user input for specific data types. It also introduced attributes like placeholder, required, pattern, etc., for enhanced form validation and user experience.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier versions lacked native support for creating dynamic graphics and animations within the browser.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which provides a JavaScript-based API for rendering 2D graphics and animations directly in the browser. It allows developers to draw shapes, lines, text, and images dynamically, enabling rich interactive experiences.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier versions of HTML had limited support for multimedia content, often relying on third-party plugins like Adobe Flash for video and audio playback.</td>
            <td>HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins. It supports various multimedia formats and provides better control over media playback.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier versions of HTML had a more limited set of elements and attributes, and the syntax was relatively strict.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, etc., which provide better structure and semantics to web documents. It also introduced simplified doctype (&lt;!DOCTYPE html&&gt;) and character encoding (&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;) declarations.</td>

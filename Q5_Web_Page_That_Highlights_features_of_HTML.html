    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <p>Following are the features of HTML5</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Semantics:</h3>
        <p>HTML5 includes new semantic elements that provide clearer structure to web documents. Elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, 
            and &lt;aside&gt; </code>help developers organize content in a more meaningful way. Semantically structured documents improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), 
            and make it easier for developers to understand and maintain code.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Audio and Video Support:</h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduces native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins 
            like Flash. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements allow developers to include media files with ease, providing better compatibility across 
            different devices and browsers. Additionally, HTML5 offers APIs for controlling playback, seeking, volume, and other media-related 
            functions using JavaScript.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h3>Canvas and SVG Graphics:</h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduces two powerful features for creating dynamic graphics and visualizations: the &lt;canvas&gt; element and SVG (Scalable Vector 
            Graphics). The &lt;canvas&gt; element provides a bitmap-based drawing surface that allows developers to render graphics, animations, and 
            interactive content dynamically using JavaScript. SVG, on the other hand, is a markup language for describing vector graphics, allowing 
            developers to create scalable and resolution-independent images directly in HTML documents.</p>

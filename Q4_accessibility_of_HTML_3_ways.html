-->

<!-- 
Ans:
Improving accessibility in HTML involves implementing various techniques to ensure that web content can be accessed and understood by a wide range of users, 
including those with disabilities. Here are three key ways to enhance accessibility in HTML:

Semantic HTML Markup: Utilize semantic HTML elements to provide meaning and structure to web content. Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> 
help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the organization of content. This allows users to navigate more efficiently and comprehend the purpose of different sections on the page.

Alt Text for Images: Include descriptive alt attributes for images to ensure that users who cannot see the images can understand their purpose. 
Alt text should convey the content or function of the image in a concise and meaningful way. This allows screen readers to describe images to visually 
impaired users and provides context for users who have images disabled or are using text-only browsers.

Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements and functionalities can be accessed and operated using a keyboard alone, 
without relying on mouse interactions. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse due to mobility impairments or other reasons. 
Make sure to test keyboard navigation and focus states to ensure that users can navigate through links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive elements easily.

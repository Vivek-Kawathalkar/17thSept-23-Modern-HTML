Q1. List out features of HTML5 
-->

<!-- Ans:
Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, etc., 
which provide better structure and meaning to web content.

Audio and Video Support: HTML5 introduced <audio> and <video> elements, 
making it easier to embed multimedia content directly into web pages without requiring third-party plugins like Flash.

Canvas and SVG: HTML5 includes support for <canvas> element, allowing dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and interactive visualizations directly within the browser. 
It also supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for resolution-independent graphics.

Improved Forms: HTML5 introduced several new input types like <input type="email">, <input type="date">, <input type="range">, etc., 
along with attributes like required, placeholder, and autocomplete, making form validation and user input handling more robust and user-friendly.

Local Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, 
providing a way to persist data between sessions without relying on cookies.

Geolocation API: HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access the user's geographical location, 
enabling location-based services and features.

Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the concept of web workers, which allow JavaScript code to run in background threads, 
improving performance and responsiveness by offloading tasks that would otherwise block the main execution thread.

Responsive Design: HTML5 provides better support for responsive web design through features like media queries, 
which allow developers to apply styles based on the device's screen size, orientation, and other characteristics, enabling the creation of websites that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

Offline Application Cache: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) API, which allows web applications to specify which resources should be cached locally, 
enabling offline access to web content and improved performance by reducing the need to fetch resources from the server.

Drag and Drop: HTML5 introduced native support for drag and drop functionality, allowing users to drag elements on a web page and drop them onto designated drop targets, 
making it easier to implement interactive features like file uploads, sorting, and rearranging elements.
